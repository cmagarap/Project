                    <p><b>Data Recovery Service Rates:</b></p>

                <p>We base our estimates on the storage capacity and the extent of damage for all types of media. The price range varies depending on the problem. In order for us to provide the exact data recovery cost, we need to perform a diagnostic test first. The test will be performed upon the receipt of your device with a nominal fixed fee; the results are ready within 3 to 5 days. As soon as our technical engineers complete the diagnosis, we can give a firm, no-obligation, quote on the recovery service. That is the best time for you to decide whether you want to proceed with the data recovery or decline it. The cost is not dependent on the size of data recovered and we guarantee a <b>“No data recovered, no charge”</b> policy</p>
                <p></p>
